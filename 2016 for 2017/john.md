# John's thoughts

- Ken Streeter tells us that 1519 used openCV for their actual robot, and GRIP just for prototyping.  Considering GRIPs problems with performance and reliability, this seems like a good plan.
- Having a reasonable simulation setup could help with:
  - Getting multiple programmers working in parallel
  - Getting driver practice
  - Spending more time on testing each feature
- Gazebo and FRCSim don't look too bad, those might be worth getting working.
- When there isn't a plan for food, food become something that needs solving
