Test sensors before putting them in a competition robot (i.e. mag encoders were wonky)
Plan for sensor integration from the beginning of the mechanical design phase, especially for LOS or bulky items such as cameras and lights
Generally we do not want to implement a new technology in build season
Indexing, indexing, indexing! Knowing your mechanisms' absolute positions is ciritical for many functions
PID loop tuning doesn't need to be hard, just follow the instructions, don't be afraid to reset everything, and try hard to not get pulled into the weeds
Keep up with your teammate's code implementations and read through it. You cannot make useful contributions if you're not up to date, and you may catch bugs with your fresher eyes
Always test thoroughly
Always keep a known 'clean' code version easily available
