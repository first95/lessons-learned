If we do another practice robot:
* Think about trying to plan the post-season meeting schedule before the build season wraps up
* Consider and discuss a "programming season" which overlaps with the build season.  For example, start the software 2 weeks into the build season, so the programmers have energy for another 2-4 weeks of programming after stop build.

We could iterate on PID tuning and auto moves a lot more quickly if all the relevant parameters were stored in JSON files or something on the file system, rather than constants in the code.

What is stopping us from using the PID loops on the Talons?  Does it not work in follower mode?
