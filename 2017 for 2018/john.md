If we do another practice robot:
* Think about trying to plan the post-season meeting schedule before the build season wraps up
* Consider and discuss a "programming season" which overlaps with the build season.  For example, start the software 2 weeks into the build season, so the programmers have energy for another 2-4 weeks of programming after stop build.
