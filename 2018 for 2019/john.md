* Do we want to have a "QA" team?  It'd be kinda neat if we could distinctly have one student write a feature, then another test it.  It could improve our reliability, and help with the bottleneck problems.  It might be too much structure to aim for though.
* It might be useful to try out the "TimedRobot" paradigm
* We definitely want to clean out dead code and re-test everything next year.  It may be useful to go so far as to strip out all Power-Up -specific code.
*Formalize function checks and other pre-match routines for each events. Checklists would be good for this. 
  *batteries
  *all operator controls
  *problematic fasteners
  *frangible elements
  *other critical elements per robot design
*Pathfinder-like auto driving control appears to be the fastest currently available option (I've read that most teams never successfully implment sweeper turns) we should try hard to sort this out for next year. I have the phone number of 195's lead programming mentor who would be happy to help us. 
*Practice robots are more of a liability than an aid for auto development unless they match the competition robot very closely. We should likely focus on iterating one robot over and over while maintaining a comparable drive base for initial programming development rather than diluting our limit available effort over two complete robots. 
*Spend more time and effort in the design phase to make all mechanisms 'driver proof' i.e. I'd like a driver to be able to go full-speed into a wall without fear of damaging the robot. This should be a regular part of testing during drive practice. 
*Related to the above - going too light-weight on components isn't helping us overall. With automatic 2-spd drive working well for us we can go heavier and more durable than we have in the past two years.
