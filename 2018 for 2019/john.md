* Do we want to have a "QA" team?  It'd be kinda neat if we could distinctly have one student write a feature, then another test it.  It could improve our reliability, and help with the bottleneck problems.  It might be too much structure to aim for though.
* It might be useful to try out the "TimedRobot" paradigm
* We definitely want to clean out dead code and re-test everything next year.  It may be useful to go so far as to strip out all Power-Up -specific code.
